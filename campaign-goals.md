# Tomb of Annihilation: Campaign Goals

## The Death Curse

The death curse is a potent, world-altering phenomenon that lies at the heart of the “Tomb of Annihilation” campaign. It’s a necromantic plague engineered by the archlich Acererak to fuel his grand scheme of elevating an **atropal** to godhood.

The death curse is a global phenomenon, affecting every corner of Toril. It has thrown religious institutions into turmoil, as the inability to resurrect the dead challenges fundamental beliefs and practices.

The spreading curse, the potential for devoured souls, and the atropal’s path to godhood create a ticking clock for the players, urging them to find and destroy the Soulmonger quickly. There’s also a personal connection to the death curse for Riva and Acacia, whose parents are afflicted by it.

### What’s an Atropal?

An atropal is a huge undead creature, classified as a titan. It’s a type of powerful, primordial being. It’s not a naturally occurring creature, but rather a failed creation of an evil god, abandoned and left to drift at the edge of the Negative Plane. Acererak discovered this atropal and brought it to Toril, placing it within the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

Its body is wet, wrinkled, and bloated, with atrophied, useless legs that dangle beneath it. It never walks but instead floats ominously. An oversized, hairless head sits atop its body, featuring vacant, glassy eyes that stare blankly. Stinking ichor constantly drips from its mouth as it utters incomprehensible obscenities. Its arms are too slender, ending in tiny hands tipped with cruelly shaped nails.

Acererak’s plan is to transform the atropal into a god of death, through the Soulmonger. If the players try to destroy it, Acererak will appear to exact his revenge.

### The Soulmonger

- The Soulmonger is a necromantic artifact, located in the Tomb of the Nine Gods within the ruins of Omu, a lost city deep in the jungles of Chult.

- It draws the souls of the dying from across Toril, trapping them within its crystalline structure.

- As souls accumulate within the Soulmonger, the atropal gradually consumes them.

### Mechanics of the Curse

- Wasting Away: Humanoids worldwide who have been resurrected begin to weaken and deteriorate. Their hit point maximum decreases by 20 (1 for each day the Soulmonger, the source of the curse, has been active) and continues to decrease by 1 every midnight until the Soulmonger is destroyed or their hit points reach 0, resulting in their death. Travelling to other planes provides no escape from the curse. Attempts to increase or restore hit points are futile while the curse persists.

- Soul Entrapment: Upon death, the soul of any humanoid on the planet becomes trapped within the Soulmonger, preventing resurrection. Only the destruction of the Soulmonger can release these trapped souls.

- Resurrection Failure: Spells such as revivify, raise dead, resurrection, and true resurrection automatically fail when cast on a humanoid affected by the curse.

- Limited Scope: The curse specifically targets humanoids resurrected by magic. It doesn’t affect pre-existing ghosts or spirits, nor does it interfere with spells like speak with dead.

## Who is the Big Bad of the campaign?

There are multiple villains in this campaign, and their relationships to one another are complex. It is understandable to be confused about who the “big bad” really is. Here’s what the sources have to say:

- **Acererak** is an archlich who built the Tomb of the Nine Gods in Chult long ago. The Soulmonger is his creation, built to feed souls to an atropal until it achieves godhood. He also made a deal with Ras Nsi to protect the tomb.

- **Ras Nsi** is a yuan-ti malison who rules Omu and wants to bring about the end of the world. He leads the yuan-ti in guarding the Tomb of the Nine Gods in exchange for Acererak’s help in unlocking a gate that will release Dendar the Night Serpent.

The guardian naga **Saja N’baza** is aware of Ras Nsi’s evil plans and wants to stop him. That’s why she sends adventurers to Omu to confront him. She knows that the death curse is connected to Omu.

## Who is the *Biggest* Bad?

It’s not entirely clear who the biggest threat is - Acererak or Ras Nsi. Here’s why:

- **Acererak** is immensely powerful and has created a device that is draining the life from those who have been resurrected and preventing further resurrection magic.

- **Ras Nsi** seeks to bring about the apocalypse by unleashing Dendar the Night Serpent. 

It seems that both villains pose significant threats to the world. You will need to decide who to prioritise, based on the information you gather during your adventures and the decisions you make in the campaign.

## Introducing Acererak

The campaign uses a slow burn approach to introduce Acererak. While the players will quickly learn about the Soulmonger and the death curse, the sources are designed to keep Acererak’s role a mystery for some time.

**Syndra Silvane** knows very little about the Soulmonger. Her information comes from the Harpers, who got it from a lich, but she doesn’t know that lich’s identity.

The party is likely to encounter several guides and NPCs who are knowledgeable about Chult. However, none of the guides, including Azaka Stormfang, know about Acererak or the Soulmonger.

The random encounters table in your sources does not include Acererak or any creatures directly associated with him.

This means that the players are unlikely to run into Acererak or learn his name until they reach Omu and begin exploring the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

### Hint & Clues

The sources offer a few hints that might lead the players to Acererak’s existence, if they are particularly perceptive:

- The **gargoyles** encountered in Omu are Acererak’s servants. They guard the city from above and answer to Withers, Acererak’s undead custodian.

- **Withers**, found in the Tomb of the Nine Gods, is fanatically devoted to Acererak. His journals could provide a wealth of information about the archlich’s past and his plans for the Soulmonger.

- The obelisk outside the Tomb of the Nine Gods includes the inscription: “Fear the night when the forsaken one seizes death’s mantle and the seas dry up and the dead rise and I, Acererak the Eternal, reap the world of the living”. This directly names Acererak, but players might not understand its full significance at first.

Acererak’s first direct interaction with the players is likely to occur in area 77 of the Tomb of the Nine Gods, where he appears on a balcony overlooking a pool of swirling mist.
Acererak is described as a powerful, hate-filled archlich wielding the Staff of the Forgotten One and accompanied by a sphere of annihilation. He taunts and belittles the players, calling them “puny mortals.”

## Introducing Ras Nsi

While players quickly learn that Ras Nsi rules Omu and is a powerful Yuan-Ti malison, the depth of his history and the complexity of his relationship with Acererak unfolds slowly through various sources within the campaign.

### Ras Nsi’s Backstory

Ras Nsi was once a human paladin, a protector of the city of Mezro, who betrayed his oaths and raised an undead army to conquer the city. This betrayal led to his banishment and ultimately his transformation into a Yuan-Ti malison.

Now, his goal is to release Dendar the Night Serpent, which he believes will bring about the end of the world.

As the players progress, the campaign continues to reveal information about Ras Nsi. We learn that he is haunted by his past and fears his mortality, especially after **falling victim to the death curse**. This vulnerability makes him more complex than a one-dimensional villain, hinting at a possible internal conflict and a desperation to achieve his goals before succumbing to the curse.

While he believes Acererak will help him unlock the gate to release Dendar, he’s beginning to suspect the archlich is using him. This tension adds another layer to the campaign’s overarching narrative, potentially creating opportunities for alliances or betrayals as the players navigate the complex web of villainous relationships.

### Who are the Yuan-Ti?

- The Yuan-Ti are a race of snake-like humanoids driven from their ancient city, Hisari.

- They now inhabit the ruins of Omu, where they have established an underground temple beneath the former royal palace.

- They worship Dendar the Night Serpent, an apocalyptic god they believe will one day swallow the world.

- They are searching for a sealed portal under the Peaks of Flame, believing that opening it will allow Dendar to enter the world.

- The Yuan-Ti, led by Ras Nsi, have made a pact with the archlich Acererak. They guard the Tomb of the Nine Gods in exchange for Acererak’s help in achieving their goal of releasing Dendar.

- Presence in Port Nyanzaru: The Yuan-Ti have spies in Port Nyanzaru who monitor the activities of the merchant princes and adventurers.

### First Encounter

The first significant encounter with information about Ras Nsi comes from the guardian naga, **Saja N’baza**. When the players reach her shrine in Orolunga, she reveals that Ras Nsi and his Yuan-Ti followers are plotting to end the world from their lair in Omu, and connects him with the Soulmonger.

This establishes Ras Nsi as the immediate obstacle, the villain the players must overcome to reach the Soulmonger and stop the death curse.

The players confront Ras Nsi face-to-face for the first time in his lair, within the Fane of the Night Serpent. This encounter is the culmination of the campaign's gradual introduction of Ras Nsi, allowing the players to face the villain they’ve only heard about in rumours and warnings.
