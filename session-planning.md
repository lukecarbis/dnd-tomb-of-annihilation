*Warning: Campaign Spoilers Ahead*

# Tomb of Annihilation: Session Planning

##  Session 1

- Syndra Silvane will greet the players in Phandalin, telling them about the Death Curse
	
- Acacia’s mother and father are affected – Syndra used to be in an adventuring party with them

- Syndra offers to teleport the group to Chult to find and destroy the Soulmonger

- Introduce our players to Nyanzaru, starting at the docks

- Allow the players to settle in with a small side quest from the city

- Have the players shop for supplies

- Have the players interact with the Dinosaur Races

- Try to introduce the players to one of the guides (page 33)

- See if we can guide the players toward meeting Wakanga O’tamu

## Session 2

- Our players know they need to stop the death curse, and urgently, but they’re not sure where to start.

- We should encourage them to seek out Wakanga O’tamu, who is hosting Syndra Silvane.
	- He can be found in Goldenthrone (1 in 6 chance of being there in the day, or a 1d4 hour wait); or
	- He could also be found in Wakanga’s Villa, where he would reject visitors unless they mention Syndra; or
	- He could be introduced via Volo – we’ll come back to this.

- Wakanga can give the players a map of Chult – this is Syndra’s map, and other merchant prince’s would very much like to have it.

- Wakanga will suggest that the players seek out Jobal, another merchant prince.
	- He could be found in Jobal’s Villa, or;
	- At the Thundering Lizard, betting on dino races, or;
	- Goldenthrone (1 in 6 chance of being there in the day, or a 1d4 hour wait).

- Jobal will recommend guides – but the players already have a guide.
	- Jobal knows and recommends Azaka – he might try to somehow take a cut of the payment.
	- Jobal wants the map! He will try to steal it if he knows players have it.
	- Jobal runs a black market and is a shady figure – but the player’s might not know this.
	- Jobal will recommend seeking out Saja N’baza, the guardian naga of Orolunga.
	- It just so happens that Azalea knows Saja, and will happily lead our players there.

- At some point before leaving Nyanzaru, the players should run into Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)!
	- Bombastic, excitable personality. Prone to indulgence and boasting. Likes to talk about himself.
	- This should just be a random encounter, most likely in taverns or the streets.
	- He should make a friendly reference to their escape from the death pit in the Old City, he enjoyed the spectacle!
	- He is promoting his latest book: “Volo’s Guide to Monsters”.
	- If players purchase his book, they can consult it for information about some monsters they encounter (AC, HP, vulnerabilities).
	- Sidequest opportunity, maybe? Recover some books that were stolen by some of the merchant princes. Could be a fun stealth thing.
	- Volo won’t join the expedition.

- If the characters go anywhere near the Temple of Savras (which they might if they’re going to Goldenthrone), and linger, have them encounter Undril Silver·tusk
	- Refer to side quest 3 on page 17 – she needs to get to Camp Vengeance, and our players are headed that way

- If the characters are ready to set out, they’ll meet up with Azaka at the city gates in the morning.
	- She will ask if they have bought a canoe.
	- She will ask if they have food.
	- She will ask if they have plenty of water.
	- She will ask if they’re prepared for the mosquitos!
	- She will get increasingly annoyed as she discovers that they don’t!
	- The characters might decide to purchase them at the Grand Shuk.
		- Smart players might buy a rain catcher.

- The destination is the ruins of Orolunga, but the first main stop for resupply will be Camp Vengeance
	- This can be reached by canoe over 12 days, or 24 days on foot
	- For each day:
		- Refer to Navigation rules on page 38
		- Refer to Dehydration rules on page 38
		- Refer to the Shivering Sickness rules on page 40
		- If the players drink tainted water (any unboiled ground or river water), refer to the Throat Leeches rule on page 40
		- Refer to the Wilderness Encounters table on page 194 – three times (morning, afternoon, night)
		- Encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher
		- Roll percentile dice and check what our players encounter

- Finally, our players will arrive at Camp Vengeance (page 47)

## Session 3

- The party’s destination is the ruins of Orolunga, but the first main stop will be Camp Vengeance
	- There’s 4 days remaining in the journey to Camp Vengeance, or 8 days on foot
	- For each day:
		- Navigation rules don’t apply as long as the party sticks to the river
		- Dehydration rules don’t apply, since the party bought water catchers (so long as they still have them)
		- Shivering Sickness rules don’t apply, as the players bought mosquito repellent sufficient for a 1 way journey to Orolunga
		- Refer to the Wilderness Encounters table on page 194 – three times (morning, afternoon, night)
		- Encounters only occur on a roll of 16 or higher
		- Roll percentile dice and check what our players encounter
	- If the going is too easy, we could have the players wake up to a smashed up camp – with their water catchers ruined
		- This was done by Azaka as a tiger!

- After a few more encounters along the river, our players will arrive at Camp Vengeance (read page 47)

- At the command tent in Camp Vengeance, Commander Breakbone will ask players to carry messages and seven sick soldiers downriver to Port Nyanzaru

- Let’s be real – the players will probably refuse. At this point, Breakbone will order the party to be arrested… but

- Undril Silvertusk will intercede, and get the players off

- If the players are really smart about it, they could probably kill the entire camp, though Undril will oppose this
	- If that’s what they decide to do, treasures are limited
	- Rations and repellent can be topped up
	- The party could exchange their canoes for a single larger keelboat

- If the party want to buy a keelboat:
	- A keelboat could carry a maximum of 7 passengers
	- Since they’re desperate for resources, Breakbone might sell it for as low as 2,000 gp (which the party don’t have)
	- Typically they sell for 3,000 gp

- Setting out from Camp Vengeance to Orolunga

- After 2 days travel they will reach the Aldani Basin (page 41)

- The party must then leave the River Shoshenstar, and travel 2 days on foot through Marshland
	- Navigation rules apply here

- Then they’ll reach River Tath, and must travel an additional 6 days by boat
	- As they get closer, reveal that the players can make out a large Ziggurat to the NW – Azaka informs them that this is Orolunga

- Orolunga is 1 day walk from there – the players may choose to hide their boats in scrub to return to them
	- On return, we can decide if they’re gone or not based on a saving throw – depending on how well they were hidden

- Orolunga can be found on page 80 – use the printed maps for this

- Saja N’baza points the party to Omu, and confers a charm for each character willing to try to kill him
	- Riva: Charm of Animal Conjuring
		- This charm allows you to cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes.
	- Zacian: Charm of Heroism
		- This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes.
	- Armean: Charm of the Slayer
		- One sword in your possession becomes a giant slayer for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes.
	- Dan: Charm of Vitality
		- This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes.
	- Ryoku: Charm of Darkvision
		- This charm allows you to cast the darkvision spell as an action, no components required. Once used three times, the charm vanishes.
	- Acacia: Charm of Feather Falling
		- This charm grants you the benefits of a ring of feather falling. These benefits last for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes.

- Mark the rough location of Omu on the map
	- Between Peaks of Flame and Valley of Lost Honor

- After meeting Saja, the party is now obligated to accompany Azaka to Firefinger (before going to Omu)
	- She can point out that it’s somewhere along River Tiryki
	- Probably they want to return to Nyanzaru first


## Session 4

### Departing Orolunga

The party has learned that there’s an underground pass at the foot of the mountains NW of Orolunga, one day walk. There’s a sailboat in a cache at the end of that tunnel. Azaka, having heard about the boat (and fearing water), won’t continue with the party. Instead, she advises them to find the boat and sail NE until they reach a headland, and find the Bay of Chult (they’ll recognise it by the large number of ships). Nyanzaru lies within the bay.

She says that she’ll make her own way back to Port Nyanzaru. If the party wants to go with her, she’ll try to fob them off by saying she has to follow up a lead in Mbala. She’ll says she’ll be able to make better time on her own. Still, the party *could* still go with Azaka back through the jungle, stopping at Mbala.

### Mistcliff Mountains

Once they arrive at the foot of the mountain the party will need to search for the entrance. Everyone in the party can roll DC 19 Investigation in order to find it. If the party talks to the plants, roll a d6 – the plants know where the entrance is on a roll of 6.

If the Investigation check fails, the party can camp and try again the next day (or just head out in a different direction). The party will need to forage for food for each day they are searching.

> As you search the base of the Mistcliff Mountains, the dense jungle gives way to a rocky clearing, where towering cliffs loom like silent sentinels above. The air here feels cooler, heavy with the earthy scent of moss and wet stone. You spot a jagged fissure in the rock face, half-obscured by a cascade of vines and tangled roots. The entrance is narrow, just wide enough for one person to slip through at a time, and shrouded in shadow.

> A faint breeze drifts from deep within the mountain, carrying the scent of damp earth and a strange metallic tang. Nearby, an ancient, toppled statue lies half-buried in the dirt, its features worn smooth by time, but you can make out its serpent-like features. It seems to watch the entrance with a silent warning.

### Saja N’baza’s Tunnel

There’s a trap a few steps in. It can be discovered with a DC14 Investigation check.

If it’s discovered:

> You notice strange sigils carved into the wall. As you touch them, you hear a mournful humming in your mind. A spiral of stones on the floor glow a faint green. They seem to be linked to the magical sigils somehow.

Players can bypass the trap by stepping over the stones, leaving them undisturbed. Otherwise:

> The first few steps into the tunnel are uneventful, the sound of dripping water your only companion. But then, [leading player] nudges a cluster of small, smooth stones scattered across the floor. As the stones shift, the air changes – a deep, mournful hum begins to resonate through the walls, vibrating in your chest and ears. A loud crack echoes from behind, and you glance back just in time to see part of the ceiling crumble, sealing the way out.

> The hum grows louder, worming its way into your mind like a persistent thought you can’t shake. Faint sigils etched into the walls flicker to life, glowing a pale green. It’s as though the mountain itself disapproves of your intrusion. What do you do?

Once triggered, the trap can be disarmed by replacing the stones into their grooves, forming a spiral shape.

All players must make a DC14 Constitution saving throw, or suffer 1d8 psychic damage. Increase by 1d8 for every minute that the stones are left disturbed. If the players choose to run away, the hum eventually fades from their minds, but only after dealing an additional 3d8 damage.

The journey through the mountain takes 3 days, and requires Blindsight. If the party chooses to continue without light, it will take them 6 days.

> The oppressive darkness swallows you as you descend deeper into the heart of the mountain. Even those of you with darkvision find your sight failing, the blackness is impenetrable, thick as tar. The air is damp and cold, carrying the faint scent of minerals and decay. Every sound – your footsteps, the clink of gear, even your breathing – echoes unnaturally, bouncing back in distorted fragments that make the tunnel feel alive.

If the party still doesn’t have any food, they will all finish the journey with the Exhausted condition. There’s no food to be found in the tunnel.

### A Hidden Cove

> After days in the suffocating dark, the tunnel finally widens, and a dim glow beckons ahead. The stale air shifts, replaced by the crisp tang of salt and sea. The sound of crashing waves grows louder, and as you step out, the world opens before you in a breathtaking panorama.

> You stand high on a cliff, the ocean stretching endlessly to the horizon, its surface glittering under the shifting light of the sky. The salty breeze is cool and invigorating, carrying with it the cries of distant seabirds and the faint roar of waves breaking against jagged rocks far below. To your left, a narrow, precarious path winds its way down the cliff face toward a small sandy cove nestled at the water’s edge.

The party will need to walk down the path. It seems like a dead end, though a nice place to swim. The party will be too hungry and thirsty to relax though.

> The winding path down the cliff is steep and treacherous, but at last, you set foot on the soft sands of the cove. The cove is small and secluded, hemmed in by towering cliffs that curve protectively around it, creating a sense of isolation.

> The sand here is fine and pale, scattered with fragments of driftwood and shells gleaming in the sunlight. The air is filled with the cries of gulls – or maybe something larger – and the salty tang of the sea. Waves roll lazily against the shore, their foamy crests catching the light.

> It seems like you’ve reached a dead end. What do you do?

They’ll need to search for the hidden cache. It can be discovered on a DC 12 Investigation check. If undiscovered, the party can fish and forage, and try again the next day.

> As you move further up the beach, past the tideline where the waves can no longer reach, you notice something unusual. Tucked against the base of the cliffs, partially obscured by a cluster of jagged rocks and dense foliage, is a narrow recess in the stone. The entrance is cleverly camouflaged with driftwood and large, smooth stones arranged to look like part of the natural terrain.

> Pulling back the debris reveals a small cave. Inside, you find a neatly concealed cache: a sturdy sailboat with its mast folded and sails carefully bundled, resting on a set of weathered wooden supports to keep it off the damp ground. The boat, though simple, is seaworthy, and its hull shows signs of deliberate care – this is no forgotten relic.

> Beside the boat, a collection of supplies is stacked with precision: barrels of fresh water, sealed crates containing dried meats, fruits, and hardtack, and a coil of rope with an anchor tucked neatly beside it.

Once the players take the boat out and step the mast, they can set off.

### The Mistcliff

> The sailboat is a compact yet sturdy vessel, clearly built for practicality rather than luxury. Its wooden hull is weathered but well-maintained, the boards tightly sealed and reinforced to endure rough seas. The deck is small but efficient, with just enough room for six passengers to move about without feeling cramped.

> Below deck, the cabin is snug but thoughtfully arranged. Two narrow bunk beds line the walls, padded with simple but serviceable bedding. In the centre, a collapsible table can double as a workspace or dining area, with storage compartments cleverly tucked beneath the seats. For additional passengers, there are hooks in the ceiling where hammocks can be strung, allowing the boat to sleep up to six in a pinch, though the space would become decidedly tight.

The journey to Port Nyanzaru will take 14 days. The trip is split into two parts: The Mistcliff (first 9 days) and the Bay of Chult (final 5 days).

Roll 1d20 each day while along the Mistcliff:

1—3: Pirates! (Only once, then Nothing happens)
4—9: Quetzalcoatluses (Only once, then Nothing happens)
10—15: Rough seas
16—18: Aarakocra (Only once, then Nothing happens)
19—20: Smooth sailing (Only once, then Nothing happens)

#### Pirates

As the party sails through a narrow channel, the weather begins to shift. A thick fog rolls in, dampening sound and obscuring vision. Suddenly, from the mist, a larger vessel emerges—a pirate ship, its tattered black sails bearing the emblem of crossed swords dripping with blood. The pirates have spotted the party’s smaller craft and see easy prey.

The pirate captain, a ruthless tiefling named Captain Morvessa Saltblood, calls out from the deck of her ship. Her voice carries over the waves:

> “Give up your gold and your lives might just stay dry! Fight, and we’ll see how long you float!”

The pirate crew drops two rowboats and begins to board, while the pirate ship circles at a distance, ready to bombard if needed. The Captain Teleports to the ship with Misty Step to provide an opportunity for her rowboats to board.

**Captain Morvessa Saltblood** AC 14 / HP 60

- Rapier (2 attacks, +6 to hit, 1d8 piecing, Vex)
- Hellish Rebuke (Reaction – 2d10 Fire Damage to attacker on failed DC 14 Dexterity, or else half as much)
- Misty Step (Bonus Action – 30” Teleport)

**3 Deckhands** (Bandit Stat Block)

**3 Bruisers** (Thug Stat Block)

**1 Cannoneer** (Bandit Stat Block)

- Stationed back on the pirate ship, they fire an old but functional cannon at the party’s boat every 3 rounds. The canon finds it’s mark on a DC 12 Dexterity Check.

If the boat is hit, it begins to take on water. Party members may need to dedicate an action to patching the damage (DC 15 Survival). The boat will sink in 30 minutes, times the number of holes. Repair tools and materials can be found easily on board.

If the Deckhands are all killed, the Captain will teleport back to her ship and sail off.

If the party tries to steal the Pirate ship, they can – but if they don’t change the sails then they’ll be arrested in the Bay of Chult by a much larger Royal Navy Ship.

The pirate ship contains:
- 1d6 x 100 gp
- A locked chest containing a potion of water breathing and a +1 rapier with a hilt carved to resemble a crashing wave
- A map marked with a possible treasure location on Lantan

#### Rough seas

Roll DC 12 Constitution, or become Seasick. Suffer disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

#### Quetzalcoatluses

A flight of ld4 + 1 quetzalcoatluses is spotted overhead. They attack from the skies.

> The sun glints off the ocean as you make steady progress along the waves, the rhythmic crash of water against the hull filling the air. Suddenly, a shadow passes over the deck, followed by another, and another. Looking up, you see them — massive shapes circling high above, their wings spanning the sky like the sails of enormous ships.

> Quetzalcoatluses.

> The largest of the creatures lets out a piercing screech that rattles your nerves, and then, without warning, they dive. Massive wings slice through the air with frightening speed as they descend, talons outstretched and beaks ready to pierce and crush.

#### Aarakocra

> As your boat glides along the coast, the wind carries the faintest sound of wings beating the air—slow at first, but growing louder. From the corner of your eye, a shadow sweeps over the deck, and you catch a glimpse of a bird-like figure descending rapidly from above. The sunlight glints off what looks like a sharp, metallic weapon in its talons, its wings spread wide as it circles closer.

> The figure lands a short distance from you on the boat. It stands tall, humanoid but unmistakably avian, with gleaming feathers of gold and crimson. It grips a long spear, the weapon held in a ready stance, and its keen eyes lock onto you.

> The figure tilts its head, watching your group with careful precision. Though it hasn’t moved to attack, its posture is wary, as though sizing you up. For a tense moment, nothing happens but the sound of the waves.

If the party attacks, it flies off, and returns a short time later with 12 other Aarakocras who attack the party.

If the party speaks with him, they will discover that his name is Kaio. Kaio’s primary duty is to safeguard the aarakocra of the Windspire Nest, which is hidden high in the cliffs of the Mistcliff Mountains. But he was born in Kir Sabal, the oldest aarakocra monastery in Chult, which lies along the River Olung. Now Kaio keeps a watchful eye on the Mistcliff for threats such as pirates, dinosaurs, or other dangers.

Players can learn that Tribes of aarakocra live atop the mountains and plateaus of Chult. Their leaders are skilled dancers – they use this to cast spells, even one that grants 3 days of flight.

If the players mention Omu, Kaio says that he knows Princess Mwaxanare, who is the heir to the fallen kingdom. She resides in Kir Sabal. The Aarakocra are protecting her and her descendants until the evil is purged from Omu.

#### Smooth sailing

Remove the Exhausted condition and Seasick condition.

> The boat glides effortlessly over the calm, glassy waters, the ocean stretching out in every direction like a vast expanse of liquid sapphire. The gentle rhythm of the waves is soothing, a steady lullaby as the boat sways with a subtle, almost hypnotic motion. Overhead, the sky is a brilliant canvas of blue, dotted with soft, wispy clouds that drift lazily in the warm breeze.

> It’s a moment of quiet respite, the kind of journey that reminds you of the beauty in the simplest things—a welcome reprieve from the chaos of the world beyond the horizon.

### The Bay of Chult

> As your boat rounds the jagged headlands that mark the edge of the Bay of Chult, the horizon opens to a vast expanse of shimmering blue water, framed by lush jungle-clad hills that rise like emerald walls in the distance. The bay itself is alive with activity—a stark contrast to the desolate cliffs and wild seas you’ve left behind.

> Merchant vessels dot the waters, their sails billowing in the warm breeze as they crisscross the bay, their hulls heavy with goods destined for far-off ports. The colourful flags of distant cities flutter from their masts, a kaleidoscope of trade and commerce on the high seas.

> Dominating the scene is a massive Royal Navy ship anchored near the centre of the bay. Its pristine white sails are furled, and its hull gleams with fresh paint, the polished wood reflecting the sunlight like burnished gold. Cannons line its sides, their muzzles dark and silent but unmistakably ready. A large flag bearing the insignia of the Crown flutters proudly from the tallest mast, signaling its authority to all who enter these waters.

See page 42-43 for more – including Aremag the Dragon Turtle!

### Port Nyanzaru

> As you sail into the sheltered waters of the Bay of Chult, a towering lighthouse comes into view. Its white stone walls rise high above the rocky headland, topped with a great flame that dances brightly against the tropical sky. The light is a beacon of safety, its steady glow guiding ships through the narrow, bustling entrance to Port Nyanzaru.

> The gates of the harbour loom ahead, two immense stone towers joined by a heavy iron chains that can be raised or lowered to block the entrance. Today, the chains hang slack, and your boat slips easily between the towers, passing beneath the watchful gaze of armed guards stationed above.

> Your boat glides toward an open berth in the Harbour Ward, where a small group of figures awaits. They are clad in loose, tropical garments marked by a distinctive emblem: a golden snake coiled in an elegant spiral. As you approach, they wave you in with practiced ease, expertly guiding you into the dock.

The men tie the boat up. If asked, the men inform the party that they plan to sail the boat back to Orolunga in a few hours.

> A stern figure approaches as your boat is secured – a broad-shouldered man in a crisp, sleeveless tunic embroidered with the emblem of Port Nyanzaru. A ledger is tucked under his arm, and his sharp eyes survey your group with the practiced scrutiny of someone who has seen it all.

> “Docking fees are twelve gold. And your papers, please. Registration, captain’s seal — whatever you’ve got to prove you’ve a right to sail this ship.”

Let the players stammer and stutter, but the men with the golden snake emblem (followers of Saja N’baza) pay the fee and show the Dockmaster their papers, claiming ownership.

Once back in Nyanzaru, the party should buy more supplies. The rations they found have nearly run out.

#### FRED!

The players can find Draza in the Public Bathhouse. He’ll lead them back to his and Belym’s apartment in Tiryki Anchorage. They’ll give Fred back to the party (try to emphasise the party, not just Riva), and show how he’s domesticated.

He has learned 3 basic tricks: Stay, Follow, and Hide.

He’s also wearing the leather armour that Riva bought him. He has AC 12 / HP 12 and Multiattack.

If the party wants him to learn more, Belym and Draza can keep training him. Each skill requires 1 week of training and 30 gp.

- Stay Longer (up to 1 hour)
- Return home (somewhere in Port Nyanzaru)
- Bite (+1 to hit, 1d4 piercing)
- Claw (+1 to hit, 1d4 slashing)
- Pickpocket (Target makes a DC 10 Perception saving throw)
- Fetch (up to 100ft away)
- Deliver (to a person that can be seen)
- Alert (Raise an alert that can be heard up to 400ft away)

#### Azaka

Azaka is staying in Kaya’s House of Repose. She’s there every day between the hours of 3—10pm.

How did she reach Port Nyanzaru before them? The truth is that she can travel very quickly in tiger form. But she’ll just tell them that she can travel quickly alone.

She’ll tell the party about the item that was stolen from her: a wooden mask carved
to resemble a tiger’s face. She tells them it’s a family heirloom. She’s discovered its location: Firefinger, an ancient Chultan signal tower that’s been taken over by a flock of pterafolk.

It’s along the River Tiryki – about 6 days journey by canoe from Nyanzaru. She recommends picking up enough rations for the return journey. They’ll also need to restock their mosquito repellent.

She suggests meeting by the dinosaur training grounds in Tiryki Anchorage when the party is ready to depart.


#### Resupply

The party might be looking for places other than the Grand Souk to buy things. If they are, someone might suggest:

> “If you’re looking for a good deal on provisions and trade goods, you should head to the Dye Works, north of the Market Ward. They handle more than just dyes – some of the merchants there bring in shipments of exotic dried fruits, preserved meats, and even travel gear. Plus, it’s worth seeing for the sheer colour of it all. Just keep your wits about you; the place gets a bit chaotic.”

#### Dye Works

The party finds themselves at the bustling Dye Works in Port Nyanzaru, where vats of brightly coloured dyes bubble and workers laboriously haul heavy bundles of cloth. The air is thick with the sharp, tangy scent of pigments and the chatter of merchants haggling over fabric prices.

The party sees that Volo is here, proudly showing off his latest “discovery” — the Ring of Necrotic Spellcasting – to an audience of curious (and skeptical) locals.

Unbeknownst to the party, a Red Wizard, Thalrak Zasz, has tracked him down, seeking the ring at any cost. When the party stumbles into the scene, they are caught between the eccentric Volo and the coldly menacing Thalrak.

> You hear the sound of Volo’s unmistakable voice. Standing atop a rickety table near a vat of vivid indigo dye, he is holding court with a group of onlookers. Gesturing grandly, he proclaims:

> “Behold, my friends, a treasure of unimaginable power! The Ring of Necrotic Spellcasting! A relic of untold age and mystery, capable of channeling the very essence of life and death itself wielded by none other than your favourite intrepid explorer, Volo!”

> He waves the ring-clad hand dramatically, then is suddenly shocked as the ring emits a zap of black electricity. “Ah, just a… a harmless side effect. Pay no mind to that!”

> Before the crowd can react, the atmosphere shifts. The cheerful hum of the Dye Works is cut short as a figure in crimson robes strides into view. A Red Wizard of Thay stands tall and imposing, his shaven head gleaming in the light filtering through the canopy above. His voice is low, sharp, and brimming with menace.

> Volothamp Geddarm. That ring is not yours to keep.

The crowd quickly disperses, leaving the party, Volo, and the Red Wizard in the midst of the colourful vats.

> Volo looks to the party with a desperate grin. “Ah, my esteemed friends! Just the heroes I needed! Surely you won’t let this grim fellow relieve me of such an invaluable artefact?” He clutches the ring protectively. “It belongs in my next book, not his foul hands!”

> The Red Wizard fixes the party with a cold stare. “Stay out of this, unless you wish to share his fate. That ring belongs to the Red Wizards of Thay, and it will be returned.”

**If the party sides with Volo**, Thalrak summons two Thayan Apprentices to aid him and attacks the party, focusing on incapacitating them to recover the ring.

The battle is complicated by the Dye Works environment — spilled dyes create slick terrain, vats of boiling liquid can be tipped over, and colourful pigments erupt into clouds if struck.

**If the party sides with Thalrak**, Volo panics and attempts to escape, causing chaos in the Dye Works. He tips over vats to block the way and loudly accuses the party of “breaking an unspoken friendship contract.”

Volo flees with the ring, forcing the party to pursue him through the crowded streets of Port Nyanzaru while Thalrak watches with amusement. If the party doesn’t pursue, that’s okay.

**The party could try to negotiate**, either talking Thalrak down or convincing Volo to relinquish the ring. If Thalrak is offered the ring, he takes it and leaves. Whenever the party encounters Volo from then on, he demands that you return his book (as it was paid for by the ring), and badmouths the party in front of any bystanders.

If Volo ends up with the ring, he’ll become more powerful as he learns to wield it. At a future time, he will use it to summon an undead army and takeover the Merchant Princess Zhanthi’s business and estate.

If the party wants to shop here, most things at the lower end of the suggested price range. However, specialty items aren’t available, such as canoes.

#### Jobal’s Villa

If the party wants to get back at Jobal for stealing their map, they can! The moat is only guarded by 1 patrol of 8 gladiators, who mostly watch the bridge. If they’re alerted to a break-in attempt, they will double their number and post an additional 8 gladiator patrol to circle the walls.

Refer to page 28 for descriptions of the rooms and guards. The map can be found in a locked drawer in a desk in the library.
