*Warning: Campaign Spoilers Ahead*

# Tomb of Annihilation: Session Planning

##  Session 1:

- Syndra Silvane will greet the players in Phandalin, telling them about the Death Curse
	
- Acacia’s mother and father are affected – Syndra used to be in an adventuring party with them

- Syndra offers to teleport the group to Chult to find and destroy the Soulmonger

- Introduce our players to Nyanzaru, starting at the docks

- Allow the players to settle in with a small side quest from the city

- Have the players shop for supplies

- Have the players interact with the Dinosaur Races

- Try to introduce the players to one of the guides (page 33)

- See if we can guide the players toward meeting Wakanga O’tamu

## Session 2

- Our players know they need to stop the death curse, and urgently, but they’re not sure where to start.

- We should encourage them to seek out Wakanga O’tamu, who is hosting Syndra Silvane.
	- He can be found in Goldenthrone (1 in 6 chance of being there in the day, or a 1d4 hour wait); or
	- He could also be found in Wakanga’s Villa, where he would reject visitors unless they mention Syndra; or
	- He could be introduced via Volo – we’ll come back to this.

- Wakanga can give the players a map of Chult – this is Syndra’s map, and other merchant prince’s would very much like to have it.

- Wakanga will suggest that the players seek out Jobal, another merchant prince.
	- He could be found in Jobal’s Villa, or;
	- At the Thundering Lizard, betting on dino races, or;
	- Goldenthrone (1 in 6 chance of being there in the day, or a 1d4 hour wait).

- Jobal will recommend guides – but the players already have a guide.
	- Jobal knows and recommends Azaka – he might try to somehow take a cut of the payment.
	- Jobal wants the map! He will try to steal it if he knows players have it.
	- Jobal runs a black market and is a shady figure – but the player’s might not know this.
	- Jobal will recommend seeking out Saja N’baza, the guardian naga of Orolunga.
	- It just so happens that Azalea knows Saja, and will happily lead our players there.

- At some point before leaving Nyanzaru, the players should run into Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)!
	- Bombastic, excitable personality. Prone to indulgence and boasting. Likes to talk about himself.
	- This should just be a random encounter, most likely in taverns or the streets.
	- He should make a friendly reference to their escape from the death pit in the Old City, he enjoyed the spectacle!
	- He is promoting his latest book: “Volo’s Guide to Monsters”.
	- If players purchase his book, they can consult it for information about some monsters they encounter (AC, HP, vulnerabilities).
	- Sidequest opportunity, maybe? Recover some books that were stolen by some of the merchant princes. Could be a fun stealth thing.
	- Volo won’t join the expedition.

- If the characters go anywhere near the Temple of Savras (which they might if they’re going to Goldenthrone), and linger, have them encounter Undril Silver·tusk
	- Refer to side quest 3 on page 17 – she needs to get to Camp Vengeance, and our players are headed that way

- If the characters are ready to set out, they’ll meet up with Azaka at the city gates in the morning.
	- She will ask if they have bought a canoe.
	- She will ask if they have food.
	- She will ask if they have plenty of water.
	- She will ask if they’re prepared for the mosquitos!
	- She will get increasingly annoyed as she discovers that they don’t!
	- The characters might decide to purchase them at the Grand Shuk.
		- Smart players might buy a rain catcher.

- The destination is the ruins of Orolunga, but the first main stop for resupply will be Camp Vengeance
	- This can be reached by canoe over 12 days, or 24 days on foot
	- For each day:
		- Refer to Navigation rules on page 38
		- Refer to Dehydration rules on page 38
		- Refer to the Shivering Sickness rules on page 40
		- If the players drink tainted water (any unboiled ground or river water), refer to the Throat Leeches rule on page 40
		- Refer to the Wilderness Encounters table on page 194 – three times (morning, afternoon, night)
		- Encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher
		- Roll percentile dice and check what our players encounter

- Finally, our players will arrive at Camp Vengeance (page 47)

## Session 3

- The party’s destination is the ruins of Orolunga, but the first main stop will be Camp Vengeance
	- There’s 4 days remaining in the journey to Camp Vengeance, or 8 days on foot
	- For each day:
		- Navigation rules don’t apply as long as the party sticks to the river
		- Dehydration rules don’t apply, since the party bought water catchers (so long as they still have them)
		- Shivering Sickness rules don’t apply, as the players bought mosquito repellent sufficient for a 1 way journey to Orolunga
		- Refer to the Wilderness Encounters table on page 194 – three times (morning, afternoon, night)
		- Encounters only occur on a roll of 16 or higher
		- Roll percentile dice and check what our players encounter
	- If the going is too easy, we could have the players wake up to a smashed up camp – with their water catchers ruined
		- This was done by Azaka as a tiger!

- After a few more encounters along the river, our players will arrive at Camp Vengeance (read page 47)

- At the command tent in Camp Vengeance, Commander Breakbone will ask players to carry messages and seven sick soldiers downriver to Port Nyanzaru

- Let’s be real – the players will probably refuse. At this point, Breakbone will order the party to be arrested… but

- Undril Silvertusk will intercede, and get the players off

- If the players are really smart about it, they could probably kill the entire camp, though Undril will oppose this
	- If that’s what they decide to do, treasures are limited
	- Rations and repellent can be topped up
	- The party could exchange their canoes for a single larger keelboat

- If the party want to buy a keelboat:
	- A keelboat could carry a maximum of 7 passengers
	- Since they’re desperate for resources, Breakbone might sell it for as low as 2,000 gp (which the party don’t have)
	- Typically they sell for 3,000 gp

- Setting out from Camp Vengeance to Orolunga

- After 2 days travel they will reach the Aldani Basin (page 41)

- The party must then leave the River Shoshenstar, and travel 2 days on foot through Marshland
	- Navigation rules apply here

- Then they’ll reach River Tath, and must travel an additional 6 days by boat
	- As they get closer, reveal that the players can make out a large Ziggurat to the NW – Azaka informs them that this is Orolunga

- Orolunga is 1 day walk from there – the players may choose to hide their boats in scrub to return to them
	- On return, we can decide if they’re gone or not based on a saving throw – depending on how well they were hidden

- Orolunga can be found on page 80 – use the printed maps for this

- Saja N’baza points the party to Omu, and confers a charm for each character willing to try to kill him
	- Riva: Charm of Animal Conjuring
		- This charm allows you to cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes.
	- Zacian: Charm of Heroism
		- This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes.
	- Armean: Charm of the Slayer
		- One sword in your possession becomes a giant slayer for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes.
	- Dan: Charm of Vitality
		- This charm allows you to give yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. Once you do so, the charm vanishes.
	- Ryoku: Charm of Darkvision
		- This charm allows you to cast the darkvision spell as an action, no components required. Once used three times, the charm vanishes.
	- Acacia: Charm of Feather Falling
		- This charm grants you the benefits of a ring of feather falling. These benefits last for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes.

- Mark the rough location of Omu on the map
	- Between Peaks of Flame and Valley of Lost Honor

- After meeting Saja, the party is now obligated to accompany Azaka to Firefinger (before going to Omu)
	- She can point out that it’s somewhere along River Tiryki
	- Probably they want to return to Nyanzaru first
