# Tomb of Annihilation: Session Recaps

## Meet our Heroes

### Riva Ruin

Riva is a Tiefling Warlock. Her Eldritch Blast is powered up with a double blast, and includes knock-back. This means that she deals a lot of damage, and at a very reliable rate. She’s clever and scheming, preferring to surprise enemies rather than risk a head-on assault. She holds a powerful magical item – an unstable lightning gauntlet, wrapped in a leather pouch. She happens to be the sister of Acacia.

### Acacia Tree

Acacia is a Half-Elf Wizard. Her spell repertoire is vast - and she’s getting better at using her less combative spells at opportune moments. In combat, Acacia looks for opportunities to help her friends rather than deal damage – though she can always fall back on Ray of Frost if needed. She’s naturally inclined to follow other’s lead, but is learning to stand up for herself – especially on matters of justice.

### Armean Beheader

Armean is a Half-Orc Barbarian, with a reputation for violence. He’s not inclined to stand around and talk, when the situation could be addressed by a physical confrontation. He’s ready to rush in while others devise their plans. He’s got a huge amount of HP, and can deal a lot of damage with his war axe or thrown hand-axes. His physical size makes him a formidable opponent, and causes him to stand out in a crowd – especially considering his mohawk hairstyle.

### Zacian

Zacian is a Dragonborn Fighter. His armour is tough to get past, and his weapons give him versatility on the battleground. If an enemy is not yet within reach, he might switch from dual swords to shurikens, before rushing in and disabling his foe with a leg sweep or grapple. He also carries two powerful magical artefacts: a dagger which grants him Darkvision, and a Bag of Holding (which currently contains an animated Living Hand, created by a Red Wizard). Zacian happens to be the cousin of Roku.

### Ryoku

Ryoku is a Dragonborn Paladin. She’s blessed with a very high HP, as well as comprehensive armour. Capable of being both effective in dealing damage with her battle axe and healing injured party members, she’s often on the frontline of combat. Her mother recently died, and now she’s on a quest to find her father and brother in order to deliver the bad news – though she doesn’t know where or how to find them. 

### Dan the Short

Dan is a Dwarf Cleric. His blessings prepare the party when they can sense something big is about to happen, and his healing spells keep his teammates going when they’re badly injured. The group also relies on him when dealing with the undead – his Holy Symbol drives the hordes away, freeing the main damage dealers to fight against greater enemies. Dan can control the minds of lesser beasts, and cure curses, poison, or even death. He’s laconic, direct, and often kinda apathetic.

## Where we left off with our previous campaign

- The party destroyed the Black Spider in the Wave Echo Cave, thus completing the Lost Mine of Phandelver campaign.

- Our characters finished on Level 5.

## Session 1

- We left our players in **Port Nyanzaru**, after having completed a small side-quest.

- The side-quest involved rescuing **Draza** from execution by raptor, in a pit outside the city gates.

- Riva bought a pet monkey named **Fred**, who is training with **Belym** and **Draza**.

- After jockeying in a dinosaur race, Zacian has bought a large dinosaur saddle.

- The group split up to explore the Red Bazaar.
	- Acacia, Riva, and Armean stayed at Kaya’s House of Repose.
	- Zacian, Ryoku, and Dan and stayed at the Thundering Lizard.

- Our players have organised to meet **Azaka Stormfang** at the city gates tomorrow morning. She will be their guide.
	- Rather than paying her, they have agreed to help her retrieve something stolen from her by some Pterefolk.
	- They don’t know she’s a were-tiger.

- We read her description wrong — she’s not supposed to be a tabaxi, but since the players love that we’ll go with it.

## Session 2

- First we tried to find Goldenthrone, in order to reach **Wakanga O’tamu**

- On the way, we met **Undril Silver·tusk** at the **Temple of Savras**
	- Undril mentioned wanting to travel to **Camp Vengeance**, but that didn’t mean anything to the group just yet

- Eventually, the group arrived at Goldenthrone, and chanced to run into Wakanga there

- They followed him to his Villa, where he gave them a partial **Map of Chult**, and redirected them to Jobal for more info

- The group found Jobal watching Dinosaur races at the **Thundering Lizard**

- Jobal told the group to seek out **Saja N’baza**, the guardian naga of **Orolunga** in order to find the Soulmonger

- Jobal also offered to buy the map — there was an intense confrontation about it

- Jobal gave the group 300 gold, and promised to return the map (along with 300 additional gold) after making a copy

- The party stayed at Kaya’s House of Repose

- The next morning they found Azaka Stormfang waiting at the city gates

- Azaka was annoyed that they weren’t prepared, and provided the group with a comprehensive shopping list (including 2 canoes)

- After Jobal’s deadline expired, the group went to his manor to confront him about it

- The guards there (who far outnumbered the party) told them to sod off

- Eventually the head guard consulted with Jobal and returned with a copy of the map, but no money

- The party was very annoyed! After scheming for far too long, they sought Wakanga’s help

- Wakanga refused to help, but provided them with a second copy of the map
	- Now they have two copies

- More scheming ensued, but without a clear way to bypass so many guards, the party eventually gave up

- The next morning, the party met Azaka and Undril at the city gates

- **Azaka Stormfang** and **Undril Silver-tusk** joined the party
	- Azaka knows Saja N’baza in Orolunga, and will accompany them there, after which she requires their help to find the Mask of the Beast
	- Undril will join the party as far as Camp Vengeance

- Right as they left the gates, the party met **Artus Cimber**, who was on his way into the Nyanzaru
	- He was not with his friend **Dragonbait** — the DMs intend to have them meet in Nyanzaru
	- He told them that he intended to travel to Orolunga, but refused to travel there with the party
	- Acacia cast Detect Thoughts, and was able to determine that the ring Artus wore is important

- After that chance encounter, Riva summoned **Bunglebond** via the Golden Kazoo

- Bunglebond told them that Artus is being chased by **Frost Giants**

- After setting out, the party saw 2 Diplodocuses, but managed to avoid them

- The party encountered **Aldani** (lobsterfolk) who asked them to move on, which they did without confrontation

- They also encountered a **Giant Constrictor Snake**, which fell into one of the canoes
	- They fought it and killed it without incident, but the event highlighted the fragility of skin canoes

- They also encountered a **Giant Crocodile**, which snatched Acacia into its jaws and very nearly killed her!
	- They fought it and killed it, harvesting some teeth, steak, and skin afterwards

- After resting the night, the party discovered that the Giant Crocodile had been devoured by animals in the night
	- They don’t realise that it was **Azaka** in were-tiger form
